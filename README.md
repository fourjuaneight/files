# Files

![worker](https://github.com/fourjuaneight/files/actions/workflows/worker.yml/badge.svg)<br/>

Uploading files to B2 involves a ton of shit, so this worker takes care of all that and gives me a simple endpoint to send a FormData payload to upload files.

All code is self-documented. Aside from the specific names of bases and tables in Airtable, everything is easily portable and ready to fork. You'll just need to provide your environment variables.
